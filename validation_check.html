	<h3>How you can fix this?</h3>
	<p>I didn't understand a lot of the errors but most of them were involved in the java coding I think so I would say go back and take a look at that code.</p>

	<h3>How you can fix this?</h3>
	<p>Alot of the errors that I have found are due to using obsolete tags and also a lack of css. Using more css and updating verbage in the tags would resolve most problems.</p>

	<h3>How you can fix this?</h3>
	<p>Most errors are caused by not adding closing tags and also issues in the spacing between characters. Simply adding space could change the errors.</p>

	</table>
	<h3>How you can fix this?</h3>
	<p>A lot of errors were due to the fact that there was insufficient spacing in between characters which could have been due to a white space compression but if not then I would go back in and space everything.</p>
